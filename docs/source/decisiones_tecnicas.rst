- **API versioning**: Allows future changes without breaking compatibility.
- **Docker and Docker Compose**: For reproducible and multi-service deployment.
- **Professional logging**: Centralized, with automatic rotation and environment-based configuration.
- **Flexible configuration**: Uses environment variables and `.env` files.
- **Static typing**: Improves code robustness and maintainability.
- **Testing and linting**: Promoted via pytest, black, and flake8.
